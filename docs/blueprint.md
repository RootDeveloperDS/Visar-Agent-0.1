# **App Name**: VISAR Agent 001

## Core Features:

- DeepSeek Integration: Generate code snippets and answer coding-related questions using the DeepSeek API. The DeepSeek model will act as a tool and decide whether and when to incorporate existing code.
- API Key Handling: Allow users to pass their DeepSeek API key via URL parameter for personalized usage.
- VISAR-Themed UI: Implement a dark UI theme with futuristic colors and neon gradients, optimized for embedding in a smaller viewport (e.g., 238x238 or larger).
- Vercel Deployment: Deploy both frontend and backend components as a single Vercel application.
- Copy to Clipboard: Provide a simple way for users to copy the generated code snippet.
- Support Multiple languages: The App should Support Multiple languages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Indigo (#f04a29) to convey futuristic and energetic aesthetics, reflecting the coding environment.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#2F4F4F), offering a dark backdrop that complements the neon and futuristic elements while reducing eye strain in a coding context.
- Accent color: Cyan (##d932bd) to highlight important interactive elements, creating a visually striking contrast against the Electric Indigo and drawing attention to actionable items.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text, lending a modern, techy, and clean aesthetic appropriate for code-related content.
- Use glowing, simplified icons to represent different code languages or actions, enhancing the futuristic UI theme.
- Optimize the layout for small embed sizes, ensuring all essential UI elements are visible and usable within the limited space.
- Incorporate subtle neon glow animations on interactive elements and during the code generation process to enhance the futuristic feel.
